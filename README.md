# Codsoft-  Virtual Internship

Welcome to my Data Science Virtual Internship repository, where I've completed three tasks related to data science and machine learning. In this internship, I worked on three projects: Titanic Survival Prediction, Iris Flower Classification, and Credit Card Fraud Detection. Below, you'll find an overview of each project, including a brief description, technical background, and how to run the code.


## Project Descriptions

### 1. Titanic Survival Prediction

- **Description:** This project involves predicting the survival status of passengers on the Titanic based on various features such as age, gender, class, and more. It's a classic machine learning classification problem.
- **Technical Background:** I used Python for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model building. Popular libraries like pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib were utilized.


### 2. Iris Flower Classification

- **Description:** In this project, I built a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal dimensions.
- **Technical Background:** I used Python for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The scikit-learn library was instrumental in this classification task.

### 3. Credit Card Fraud Detection

- **Description:** This project focuses on the detection of credit card fraud using machine learning algorithms. It involves handling imbalanced datasets and building a model to identify fraudulent transactions.
- **Technical Background:** Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and imbalanced-learn were used to preprocess the data, train models, and evaluate their performance.

Feel free to explore the individual project repositories for more details. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. Thank you for visiting my internship portfolio!
